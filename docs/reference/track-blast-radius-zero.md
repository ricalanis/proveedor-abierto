# Track: Blast Radius Zero — Safe Agent Execution on Vultr (official challenge text, condensed)

We compete in this track. This file quotes and condenses the official challenge description and maps each
requirement to our design. It's the checklist every slice, brief and demo beat must satisfy.

> Build a web-based agent that performs real work (writing and running code, or operating a real browser)
> with every action contained inside a sandbox running on Vultr. Your system should act as a centralized
> control layer that plans a task, dispatches it to an isolated execution environment, and returns verifiable
> output. Multi-step agentic workflows, real executed results rather than described ones, and a production-style web
> application, all on Vultr. "An agent that only chats is a demo; an agent that executes safely is a product."

## Execution patterns (we do both)
- **Pattern B — Sandboxed Browser Use (primary):** goal → model plans → Playwright in a container navigates,
  clicks, types → screenshots return → **a vision model on Serverless Inference verifies the result** → repeat,
  **with a human approving anything final**. The track's own example **"Research with Receipts"** (every claim links to a
  screenshot of its source) is exactly our evidence model.
- **Pattern A — Sandboxed Code Execution (secondary):** model writes code → runs in a container → real output →
  on error, **stderr is fed back for a retry**. Our instance: `code.write/test/promote/repair`, where the agent writes
  an extractor for a source, runs it in the sandbox against stored captures, reads the failures, patches and retries,
  and promotes it to a crystallized macro. The retry loop must be **visible on screen** ("Self-Healing Runner").

## Requirement → our answer → status (updated 18:07; gaps tracked in coord/GAPS.md)
| Requirement | Our answer | Status |
|---|---|---|
| VM-based backend on Vultr (mandatory) | VX1 control plane (FastAPI engine + app) + VX1 sandbox host | ✓ live: control VX1 + sandbox VX1 (4 vCPU), both zero public ports |
| Agent LLM calls via Vultr Serverless Inference (mandatory) | All agent reasoning on Vultr (`generated_by.backend=vultr`); Jev is only a supporting typed-decision helper, allowed per judges | ✓ live; R9 open: the engine still holds its own key, moving behind the gateway |
| Vultr = central control and orchestration | Engine plans on Vultr models, dispatches pods to VM #2, optional throwaway instance per risky task via the Vultr API | ✓ plans + dispatches cells from the control VM; throwaway VX1 per task CUT (account fee cap) |
| Sandboxes never in the app process | Docker + gVisor pods on a separate VM; internal network + egress proxy | ✓ live: gVisor cells on the sandbox VM, driven from the control VM over NetBird |
| **Process isolation** | gVisor `runsc`, no host mounts, internal network | ✓ live: runsc, isolation probes BLOCKED |
| **Secret hygiene: no API keys or credentials inside the sandbox** | Pods get **zero** secrets; every LLM call is made by the control plane; containers can't reach the metadata IP (cloud-init) or the NetBird mesh. A proof probe asserts the pod env/fs has no keys | ✓ live: secrets checkpoint (0 keys; metadata + mesh BLOCKED) |
| **Resource limits: time and memory caps on every run** | Per pod: `--memory`, `--cpus`, `--pids-limit`, wall-clock timeout, max steps; recorded in `jobs.jsonl` | ✓ live: caps + limit_kill (destructive loop killed on runsc) |
| **Lifecycle discipline: reset/destroy after each task** | Pod destroyed per job (teardown checkpoint); throwaway VX1 per high-risk task (optional) | ✓ live: cell destroyed per session (teardown checkpoint) |
| Vision model verifies each browser step (Pattern B) | `qwen3.8-27b` (verified live) judges the post-action screenshot against the step goal = the termination predicate; Jev may pre-screen | built in the controller; on the engine path via R3 (in progress) |
| Human approves anything final | Read-only by design (no irreversible actions); an **approve-before-submit gate** blocks any non-SAFE/LOW action and asks the approver in the app; the PRD/factors/ontology checkpoints are approvals too | ✓ console approvals (SSO, digest-bound); action gate on the engine path via R3 |
| Public web app, product-style, clear user flows | Proveedor Abierto app (dossier, run view, journal) behind NetBird reverse proxy with role gating | ✓ live: Ontofill Console (B2B) + Proveedor Abierto (B2C) behind NetBird |
| REST/WebSocket for run status + streaming | Live run feed (§4b) + app SSE/polling | ✓ live feed + console run view |
| Dashboards: execution loop, retries, screenshot trails | `/run`: step stream with modes, escalations, repairs, thumbnails, proof | ✓ console run view; real verdicts/retries arrive with R3/R4 |
| **Containment moment in the video** (sandbox absorbs rm -rf, infinite loop or hostile page) | Hostile page: prompt injection + attempts to reach the metadata IP or other domains → BLOCKED and flagged; Pattern A: an extractor that runs `rm -rf /` or loops forever → killed by the timeout/memory cap, host untouched | fixtures pass live on runsc; in-run trigger = R8; recording = R13 |
| GitHub repo with setup + docs | github.com/ricalanis/ontofill, github.com/ricalanis/proveedor-abierto | ✓ public; setup docs R13 |
| Public demo URL | NetBird reverse-proxy URL (investigator), zero open ports | ✓ live (console SSO; product password) |
| Recorded demo video | 1-min plan in proveedor-abierto `docs/demo/` | R13 |
