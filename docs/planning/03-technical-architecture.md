# Ontofill + Proveedor Abierto: technical architecture (v1, 2026-09-26)

This is the canonical architecture. It supersedes the architecture sketch in `ontofill-plan.md` where they differ.
`01-engine-definition.md` defines *what* the engine is; `02-anticorruption-definition.md` defines the reference case;
this document defines *how the system is built and runs*. The acceptance bar is
`../reference/track-blast-radius-zero.md`. Interfaces between the repos are pinned in the orchestration contract.

**One line:** a control plane that plans on Vultr models and dispatches disposable sandboxes, turning an open
question into a verified, evidence-backed dataset and an investigation app.

```

## 1. Definition: turning a question into a contract (P1–P2)
- **Brief → PRD** (Vultr inference): personas, jobs to be done, DoD as testable criteria, constraints, and an
  **authority policy** (which publishers count as official for this case's jurisdiction). **Human checkpoint.**
- **PRD → ontology**, Simula-style (`01-engine-definition.md` "Phase 2 method"): factors of variation → taxonomies
  (Best-of-N proposals + a critic from a different model family) → classes, properties, relations, the primary class,
  DoD fields, SHACL rules and signal rules, and alignment (schema.org / Wikidata / a domain standard) → DoD compiled
  to queries. **Human checkpoints** for factors and ontology.
- **Generic by construction:** no domain vocabulary in engine code (a guard test enforces it). A different brief
  yields a different ontology, sources and extraction with zero code changes (a second-brief test proves it).

## 2. Discovery: where the data lives (P3)
- Ontology gaps become targeted queries. Keyless providers: model-proposed candidates, Wikidata official websites,
  open-data catalogs, and web search when not blocked. **A candidate is only a lead; a sandbox capture must confirm
  it.** The authority check applies the approved policy; anything else goes to human approval.
- Output: ranked (source, objective) pairs, each tagged `discovered_by`. Optional site-graph spider sessions run
  on the same cells.

## 3. Local scoping: how to extract from each source (P4)
- A **technical definition document (TDD)** per (source, objective): target properties, the path through the site,
  the method (file / DOM / vision), validation, rate limits, budget, allowed domains, and the **execution-mode range**
  (e.g. start D0, may escalate to S1, never S2). Requester ⇄ source-engineer negotiation when time allows.

## 4. Execution: doing the work in sandboxes (P5)
| Mode | What runs | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **D0** | download + parse (CSV/XLSX/PDF/API), no model | cell or control plane (read-only fetch through egress) |
| **D1** | a crystallized script; the model only maps, parses or repairs fields | cell |
| **S1** | the native agent loop: observe → **Jev gate** → plan (Vultr tool call) → **Jev action guard** → act → **Jev check** → **Vultr vision verify** | native cell (gVisor Chromium hands) |
| **S2** | Skyvern for hard navigation, one unmodified Skyvern brain per cell | Skyvern cell |
- **Escalate** on failed termination predicates, stale bindings, SHACL failures, drift or low yield; **stop** on
  captcha or login. **Crystallize** (Pattern A): write → test on stored captures → read the failure → patch → retry →
  promote a versioned macro; next time it runs at D0/D1. The retry loop is visible in the run view.
- Every step logs **observed / requested / executed / evaluated**, plus mode, backend (vultr | jev | recorded) and cost.

## 5. The browser layer: controller + cells + inference gateway
- **Controller** (MCP service on the control plane): `session.open(tdd, allowed_domains, limits)` →
  `{session_id, live_view_url}`, `act`, `observe`, `close`; a session broker; a warm pool of cells; **recycle = destroy
  + recreate after every session**. Backends: `native` (primary, concurrent) and `skyvern` (S2, one per cell).
- **Cell** = **hands** (gVisor Chromium pod, egress allowlist proxy, memory/cpu/pids/timeout caps, zero secrets) +
  optional **brain** (upstream Skyvern containers, unmodified, holding only a session token). Each cell has its own
  internal network: brain → hands over CDP inside the cell; hands egress only via the allowlist; brain egress only to
  the gateway; no access to the metadata IP, the mesh or other cells. Optional placement: a throwaway VX1 per cell via
  the Vultr API ("Vultr itself as the sandbox fabric").
- **Inference gateway** (control plane): an OpenAI-compatible proxy in front of Vultr. It holds the **only real key**,
  issues per-session tokens (TTL, $ budget, revoked at close), attributes every call to a session and step for spend,
  and runs **Jev + the Vultr content-safety model on page content inside prompts before forwarding**, which gives a
  per-step hook even inside Skyvern's own loop.

## 6. Refinement: from raw to trusted
- **Cut (user, 18:07):** Oxigraph silver/gold graphs; silver is Postgres, gold is the JSONL/CSV/RDF export. Simula runs at depth 1
  with a separate critic (depth 2, sampling mixes and Elo are cut). P4 negotiation and the P1 research ledger are cut. See
  `coord/GAPS.md` for the full cut list.
- **Bronze:** immutable, content-addressed captures (HTML, accessibility tree, screenshots, files, site graphs) in
  Vultr Object Storage. **Silver:** typed observations with evidence; duplicates and conflicts kept. **Gold:**
  reconciled, SHACL-valid values (the double critic is cut).
- Entity resolution uses identifiers compared in code plus model confirmation. Metrics and DoD are computed on gold;
  gaps loop back to discovery. An ontology or PRD change **re-refines gold from bronze without re-browsing**.
- Gold export (generic): `entities.jsonl` + `ontology.json` + `trace.jsonl` + `jobs.jsonl` + `metrics.json`
  (with `dod[]`), plus a live run feed during execution.

## 7. Two products: the engine console (B2B) and Proveedor Abierto (B2C) (user decision, 17:44 Sat)
The engine and the case product are separate products with separate URLs, and they don't mix.
- **Ontofill Console** (engine, B2B, in `ontofill/console/`): the operator and approver surface for ANY case the engine
  runs (the procurement case, the library demo brief, anything else). A case registry lists them. Per case: runs with
  the live step stream (modes, loop threads, verdicts, retries, screenshots, the six proof checkpoints, "decided by code /
  Jev / Vultr"), the live view of a cell, **approvals** (PRD, factors, ontology, approve-before-submit actions:
  SSO identity, digest-bound decisions, append-only decision log, CONTRACT v0.9.7), spend, the track evidence page, and
  replay. It knows nothing domain-specific: labels come from each case's ontology. Behind NetBird SSO (operators/approvers).
- **Proveedor Abierto** (case product, B2C, `proveedor-abierto/app/`): a consumer-grade reader of ONE case's gold
  export. Suppliers, dossier per entity with its receipts (evidence one click away), red flags as explained signals (not
  accusations, with a dispute path), relationships, the journal (any value → step → TDD → objective → ontology → PRD →
  brief), watchlist, open exports (OCDS/CSV/RDF), and a plain "how complete is this" view. No approvals, no run control,
  no spend, no engine internals. It reads the published gold export only, never the live run or the case's pending files.

## 8. Safety model (the track's core)
- **Isolation:** gVisor `runsc`, a network isolated per cell, egress allowlist, resource caps, destruction after every session.
- **Secrets:** the real key lives only in the gateway. Hands hold nothing; brains hold a session-scoped, budget-capped,
  revocable token. *No long-lived credential in any sandbox.*
- **Read-only archetype:** SAFE/LOW actions only (navigate, search, filter, paginate, download); anything else pauses at
  the **approve-before-submit gate**; captcha or login = stop and flag; nothing is bypassed.
- **Proof per job (six checkpoints):** host (runtime, KVM), the task's real result, hostname/uname from inside, an
  isolation probe = BLOCKED, teardown, secrets (0 keys; metadata + mesh BLOCKED).
- **Containment moments for the demo:** a hostile page (prompt injection plus exfiltration attempts) is flagged,
  quarantined and BLOCKED; an extractor running `rm -rf /` or an infinite loop is killed by the caps with the host untouched.
- **Zero-port access (NetBird):** the public URL goes through the reverse proxy with role gating; zero inbound ports on both
  VMs (SSH included); VM↔VM over WireGuard with one-way policies ("fence in your agents"); per-cell live-view URLs via
  `netbird expose` that die with the cell.

## 9. Observability and cost
- The run feed streams to the app; the gateway logs every model call with session/step attribution; `tools/spend`
  tracks the $200 credit (alerts at 50/75/90%). Jev's savings (vision calls avoided) appear in the run view.

## 10. Where things live
| Where | What |
|---|---|
| `github.com/ricalanis/ontofill` | generic engine, `ontofill-scrape` toolkit, schemas, sandbox/cell substrate, infra (Vultr, NetBird), `services/browser-agent` (controller + gateway + backends), `console/` (the engine console, B2B) |
| `github.com/ricalanis/proveedor-abierto` | case package (brief → PRD → ontology → TDDs → macros, produced by the engine and approved by humans in the console), the consumer app (B2C), deploy |
| Vultr (outside git) | VMs, Object Storage (bronze), Postgres + Oxigraph (silver/gold), Serverless Inference |
| NetBird Cloud | peers, groups, policies, reverse-proxy services, expose sessions |

## 11. Model roles (live-verified on Vultr, see `../reference/vultr.md` §2.10)
| Role | Model / backend |
|---|---|
| Planning, PRD, ontology generation | `glm-5.3` |
| Critic (different family) | `minimax-m3` / `qwen3.8-27b` |
| Typed decisions | `glm-5.3-flash` (forced tool, minimal reasoning); Jev pre-screen where it fits |
| Extraction / agent next-action | `qwen3.8-flash-next` |
| Vision verification | `qwen3.8-27b` |
| Injection / content safety | Jev (one-way pre-screen) + `nemotron-3.5-content-safety` (custom policy) |
| Skyvern cells | via the gateway, OpenAI-compatible (`qwen3.8-flash-next` primary; vision per smoke test) |

## 12. Build order (revised 15:45 Sat)
1. Genericity refactor + sandbox VM + Object Storage → 2. inference gateway + controller + native backend + cell
substrate → 3. **first live run of the real case with human approvals (~20:00)** → 4. completeness push (DoD on
live inference) + discovery + Skyvern cells → 5. deploy app behind NetBird + containment scenarios + bonus evidence
(overnight) → 6. harden, cached full run, video, freeze Sun 10:00, submit by 12:00.

## 13. Phase loops and the outer gap loop (user decision, 16:26 Sat)
The harness stays deterministic (code owns phase order, budgets, stop rules and human gates), but each phase is a
**bounded loop**, not a one-shot call, and the run as a whole is a loop. The model decides *within* typed options; it
never owns control flow.
- **One skeleton, reused by every phase:** `gather → propose (Best-of-N) → critique (other model family) → revise →
  check (the phase's exit criteria compiled to code) → human gate`. Stop when the checks pass and the critic has no
  blocking objection, or when the phase budget (iterations, $, wall-clock) runs out; then present with open issues listed.
- **P1:** gather = a research ledger (public prior art, datasets, legal frame) from lead-only search confirmed by
  sandbox capture; propose PRD; critic checks invented targets, feasibility against budget, brief coverage; DoD
  criteria carry `basis: brief|human|proposed`.
- **P2:** already Best-of-N + critic (Simula); add grounding: proposed properties must be observable in sampled
  bronze captures, and every PRD DoD field must be covered.
- **P3:** discovery loop: ontology gaps → queries → leads → capture-confirm → authority check → re-rank, until each
  DoD field has ≥ 1 confirmed candidate source (≥ 2 for high-stakes fields) or budget.
- **P4:** requester ⇄ source-engineer negotiation (two roles, ≤ N rounds) → TDD, validated by a dry run on one capture.
- **Outer gap loop (the run itself):** after P5 → refine → gold metrics vs DoD → gap analysis → a typed decision:
  reopen P3 (new sources), P4 (renegotiate a TDD), P2 (ontology recommend, human gate) or stop. Bounded by the run
  budget; every iteration is a trace event, so the run view shows the engine arguing with itself and closing gaps.
- Human denials feed the same loop as `human` revisions (CONTRACT v0.9.5); the loop never overrides a human basis.
